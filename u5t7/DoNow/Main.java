public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // creating a Rectangle object and getting its area
        // using the area instance method
        Rectangle myRect = new Rectangle(3, 10);
        double rectArea = myRect.area(); // calling the area instance method
        System.out.println(rectArea);

        // converting feet to inches using the
        // feetToInches static "utility" method
        double inches = Rectangle.feetToInches(6.5); // calling the feetToInches STATIC method
        System.out.println(inches);

        // 1. Look at the code above; PREDICT the output -- then run to confirm.
        // -> ANSWER Question a) what was the printed output?

        // 2. Note how the area method and feetToInches are being called above;
        // -> ANSWER Question b) how is calling the area instance method
        // different from calling the feetToInches static method?

        // 3. Compare the code for the area and feetToInches methods
        // in the Rectangle class;
        // -> ANSWER Question c) which method makes use of instance
        // variables and which one doesn't?

        // 4. Try adding the "static" keyword to the area method then running
        // the code above again; what is the error? (now change the method
        // back to non-static)
        // -> ANSWER Question d) can static methods use instance variables?

        // 5. Add a perimeter method to the Rectangle class that returns
        // the perimeter of the Rectangle object as a double
        // THEN ADD TEST CODE BELOW THAT USES THE METHOD TO OBTAIN
        // AND PRINT THE PERIMETER OF the myRect object created above (should be 26.0)
        System.out.println(myRect.perimeter());

        // 6. -> ANSWER Question e) copy/paste your perimeter method and
        // the test code you wrote above

        // 7. -> ANSWER Question f) Did you write the perimeter method
        // as an instance method or a static method? Why?
        // If you made the method static, try making it non-static
        // and vice versa; can it be written the other way? Why or why not?

        // 8. Add a inchesToFeet "utility" method to the Rectangle class that has
        // a double parameter and returns that value converted to feet
        // THEN ADD TEST CODE BELOW THAT USES THE METHOD TO OBTAIN
        // AND PRINT 100 inches converted to feet (should be 8.333...)
        System.out.println(Rectangle.inchesToFeet(100));

        // 9. -> ANSWER Question g) copy/paste your inchesToFeet method and
        // the test code you wrote above

        // 10. -> ANSWER Question h) Did you write the inchesToFeet method
        // as an instance method or static method? Why?
        // If you made the method static, try making it non-static
        // and vice versa; can it be written the other way? Why or why not?

        // 11. -> ANSWER Question j) what kind of methods do you think
        // make good candidates for instance methods and which make
        // good candidates for static methods?

        // 12. -> ANSWER Question k) inchesToFeet could have been written as
        // a static method or instance method; in this situation,
        // which do you think is preferred?
    }
